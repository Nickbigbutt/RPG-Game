Welcome to my game!

This is sadly a unfinshed project. I did not have time to complete it to full. 

I have to main menu created, character creation and character selecteion. 
You will probably notice all the missing elements that i did not have time to finish if you try it.


How to do what works.

1. Start with "Character creation" by pressing "1"
2. Then you press "1 again to make a new character.
3. After that you name the character.
4. Then you have to type "-1" to get back to the main menu.
5. there after you press "3" to select a character.
6. Depending on how many characters you have made, you type the number for the character you want to select.
7. Then you will see some stats and Exp progress bar.

 that is sadly all I had time to make.
